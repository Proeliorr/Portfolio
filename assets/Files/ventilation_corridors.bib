The literature review shows that the Floor Area Ratio ({FAR}) index is one of the best indicators to detect urban development; therefore, this was the core of the analysis. Three periods were analysed (1992 – 2002 – 2011), as such a long time-span allows the assumption that change will be visible. The ventilation corridors were divided into 500 m and 100 m grids and the {FAR} index was calculated for each cell. The results highlight alarming changes within some of the corridors, indicating areas that are crucial to sufficient air flow in Warsaw.},

Several ventilation paths are clearly recognisable for all three decades and based on the proximity analysis and roughness parameters (by calculating roughness length (z0) and zero-plane displacement height (zd)), we established their extent and analysed the structural and developmental changes. We conducted that changes occurred more rapidly in the second period – almost 90\% of the study area was gradually built up, what obstructs the air flow. In addition, winds are blocked in the western part of the city – where the best wind conditions occur. The results urge to re-evaluate the current shape of ventilation corridors and suggest some new areas that should be included in the air ventilation system to improve citizens’ comfort and urban climate.},

The effectiveness of solar control shading was tested depending on the geometric relationships between trees and buildings. Numerical simulation analyses were conducted in Rhinoceros® program for the street located in humid continental climate in city Płock, Poland (52°32′50 “N 19°42’00 “E), for the day of the highest degree of total solar radiation in the year i.e. June 7th, during hours: 8.00a.m - 5.00 p.m. The analysis has proved that a row of 20–25 year old Sycamore Maple ‘Rotterdam’ in the street 30 m wide and 18 m high (H/W = 0.6), can provide solar protection for the southern frontage, especially when trees are located no more than 4 m away. Location of greenery within the range of 4 to 5 m from the buildings leads to a radical reduction in the possibility of shading the wall surfaces (at 5 m to 0\%). Over 90\% of the shading area of the ground floor façade walls was found when trees were within the distance 2 and 3 m away from the building.},

	abstract = {Ventilation corridors in cities can decrease air pollution and alleviate heat island problems but there remains a need to fully assess their effectiveness. Few urban managers have been able to take city-scale approaches to the construction of urban ventilation corridors. This study aimed to introduced the Ventilation Corridor Planning ({VCP}) model, which is a multi-criteria evaluation method combined with a geographical information system ({GIS}) to determine where the ventilated environment is most appropriate. Specifically, the {VCP} model took Bozhou, China as the research object and contained two scales, including mesoscale and local scale. In mesoscale scale, we got three outputs to build urban ventilation corridors, including 1) background wind environment, 2) ventilation potential, 3) heat island intensity. In local scale, we used traditional computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) model to verify the impact of {VCP} criteria. The results revealed that compared with the traditional {CFD} model, the proposed {VCP} model has advantages in establishing a comprehensive evaluation standard. In addition, the application of {VCP} model in macro and micro also enhances the efficiency of ventilation corridor construction. Overall, this study introduced a effective modeling method to urban ventilation corridors planning, and provide a way to study the urban climate.},

The frontal area index is calculated for uniform 100 m grid cells, based on three dimensional buildings in each cell, for eight different wind directions. The frontal area index is then correlated with a land use map, and the results indicate that high density commercial and industrial areas with large building footprints had higher values than other urban land use types. Using the map of frontal area index, the main ventilation pathways across the urban area are located using least cost path analysis in a raster {GIS}. Field measurements of urban winds confirmed the significance and functionality of these modelled ventilation paths. Comparison of the pathways with a map of the urban heat island suggests that ventilation is a key parameter in mitigating heat island formation in the study area. Planning and environmental authorities may use the derived frontal area index and ventilation maps as objective measures of environmental quality within a city, especially when temperatures in the inner city are a major concern.},

Among the many factors affecting the formation of urban heat islands, urban canopy ventilation is considered to have great potential for improving urban heat islands. Based on the traditional numerical simulation of ventilation corridor analysis, this paper proposes a new approach for ventilation corridor recognition based on circuit theory. The connotations of resistance, current, and voltage in the simulation of urban ventilation environment were explained separately. Taking Wuhan as the research area, local three-dimensional building data were used as the data source, and a simulation experiment of the urban ventilation environment with different winds was carried out on the 100-m grid scale. Unlike the method based on the least-cost path analysis by which only a few main ventilation corridors can be generated, the results of the method proposed in this paper cover all grid cells in the study area. The simulation results were represented by probabilistic values, which can effectively reflect the ventilation corridor and ventilation barriers. In addition to identifying the ventilation corridors, the tuyeres were also well identified.},

Previous studies have mainly focused on the construction of urban ventilation corridors, while less attention has been given to the subsequent environmental benefits that are generated. Taking the main urban area of Hefei as an example, this study proposed a corridor construction model that was based on the ventilation resistance coefficient ({VRC}) and quantified and compared the environmental indicators for different corridor levels to understand the environmental benefits that were created. Datasets that combined architecture morphology and wind frequency were utilized to construct four-season urban ventilation corridors at a macro level. Three environmental indicators were adopted combined with the {VRC} model: i) reduction of air pollutant concentrations ({PM}2.5), ii) reduction of land surface temperatures ({LST}), and iii) utilization efficiency of vegetation space ({NDVI}). The results indicated that (1) the {VRC} that was based on the architecture morphology datasets had a significant correlation with urban environmental benefits, including the {PM}2.5, {LST} and {NDVI} levels. (2) Compared with current project-based ventilation corridors, those constructed by considering the {VRC} can provide greater environmental benefits. (3) The intersection nodes had higher ventilation benefits than other areas of the ventilation corridors and showed significant spatial aggregation characteristics in alleviating the {PM}2.5 concentrations and surface temperatures. The method proposed in this study provides important theoretical support for the improved construction of future urban ventilation corridors.},

Hangzhou, a large, dense city in eastern China, is one of the nation's hottest cities and must urgently improve its ventilation. In this study, a newly developed method combining land surface temperature retrieval, {GIS} spatial analysis, and weather data was employed to design city-level {UVCs}. The functional space and compensation space of {UVCs} are identified based on the {LandsatETM}8 image data inversion of surface temperature. The contribution of affect factors, such as building density, building height, green land area, waterbody, roads, and urban terrain, to the urban ventilation potential is calculated using {AHP} and {GIS}. Areas with tremendous ventilation potential were identified as possible ventilation corridors by using an evaluation model and considering wind characteristics. Fifty-four high-temperature zones and 48 low-temperature zones were identified as functional and compensative spaces in Hangzhou, respectively. On the urban scale, green space (area {\textgreater}500ha), water bodies (area {\textgreater}300ha or width {\textgreater}100 m), and roads (width {\textgreater}50 m) were considered to be the factors that have the greatest impact on urban ventilation potential. The {LCP} method was used to verify the accuracy and rationality of the method proposed in this study to determine the city-scale {UVC}. {UVC} planning schemes and construction measures were proposed to provide rich information and a reference basis for the new general land and space planning of Hangzhou.

It is difficult to obtain global ventilation results covering the whole study area using this method of analysis. On the basis of urban morphology and a least-cost path analysis, this study proposes a “least cumulative ventilation cost” method for analyzing urban ventilation. Taking Wuhan downtown as a research area, the urban ventilation environment under different wind directions and seasons was analyzed. This method can effectively express the ventilation conditions throughout the whole study area and can simultaneously express the quality of the generated corridors effectively. The results show that Wuhan has three levels of ventilation corridor.

Potential paths existed in the leading wind and south–north directions. The areas that required improvement were favorably situated in the path of potential ventilation corridors.

	abstract = {Urban ventilation planning ({UVP}) are critically important to sustainable and green urban development. However, the climatic-environmental effects and benefits of urban ventilation corridors have yet to be fully understood. In this study, high-resolution simulation tests were carried out for winter of 2018 and summer of 2019 using the weather research and forecasting model ({WRF}) coupled with the urban canopy model ({UCM}) and the refined surface type and {UVP} of Beijing City. After the construction of the ventilation corridors, the average temperature in the Beijing urban area can be reduced by 0.18 °C, and the wind speed and relative humidity can be increased by 0.33 m s−1 and 2.83\%, respectively. The major contributions of the ventilation corridors to local meteorological elements are the wind speed enhancement-induced advection effect and the improvement of the turbulent flux over urban surface. Further, the cost-benefit analysis of {UVP} show that the urban heat island intensity ({UHII}), the average {PM}2.5 concentration, and the number of days with light or above levels of air pollution will be decreased by 13.7\%, 11.7\%, and 20.2\%, respectively. This implies that, disregarding the reduction of the {UHII} and its effect, urban ventilation corridor is conducive to improving the winter urban living environment. However, the problems of haze pollution cannot be completely resolved by ventilation corridors alone, and the weakening of the winter {UHII} in the northern city is a disadvantage to energy-saving and habitat comfort. Our findings provide a reference base for policy decisions and technical guidelines for {UVP} of high-density cities.},

	abstract = {Accurate mapping of wind ventilation in an urban environment is challenging when large spatial coverage is required. This study has developed a {GIS}-based model for estimating the frontal area index ({FAI}) of buildings, infrastructure, and trees using very high resolution airborne light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) data, which can also be used to investigate the “wall effect” caused by high-rise buildings at a finer spatial scale along the coasts in the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. New algorithms were created by improving previous algorithms utilizing airborne {LiDAR} data in raster unit, as well as considering the backward flow coefficient between windward and leeward buildings. The ventilation corridors estimated by {FAI} and least cost path ({LCP}) analysis were analyzed. The optimal ventilation corridors passing through the Kowloon peninsula were observed in the east-west and west-east directions. In addition, these ventilation paths were validated with a computer fluid dynamics ({CFD}) model i.e. Airflow Analysis in {ESRI}. The newly developed model calculates finer {FAI} with greater accuracy when compared with vector-based building polygons. This model further depicts buildings, infrastructure, and trees which are considered as obstacles to wind ventilation. The results can be used by environmental and planning authorities to identify ventilation corridors, and for scenario analysis in urban redevelopment.},

Ventilation corridors can improve the internal ventilation conditions of a city and can effectively alleviate these urban problems. Taking Kaifeng as an example of a medium-sized city, this study used meteorological analysis and remote sensing ({RS}) technology and a geographical information system ({GIS}) to plan ventilation corridors. Through analysis of the thermal environment, the influential factors of the underlying surface (building density, road length, water length, vegetation coverage) and wind environment in Kaifeng, the compensation space and action space, and the comprehensive values of the ventilation potential in each region were determined. The results show that with the use of the single-window algorithm and Landsat8 data, high-resolution ground temperature can be retrieved. Moreover, although the ventilation potential value of Kaifeng in the northern part is better than that in the southern part, the temperature in the north is higher than that in the south. Through comparison and analysis of the location of the low-temperature zone, the air duct opening of the ventilation corridor can be determined and the source areas of three ecological ventilation corridors identified. According to the ventilation corridor air duct opening, the urban underlying surface and the dominant wind direction of Kaifeng city, two ventilation corridors located on the eastern and western sides of Kaifeng city were planned. This urban ventilation corridor planning method, which is based on temperature difference analysis and determination of the source area of the ventilation corridor, can provide a reference for the construction of an ecologically livable city.},

Optimizing urban ventilation environment could relieve these environmental problems. In this study, an Urban Ventilation Network Model ({UVNM}) was developed to explore the impact of urban morphology and building height on the urban ventilation condition. The study calculated the ventilation resistance coefficient of building height according to fluid mechanics, and then determined the least cost path among the air inlets and outlets considering the direction and frequency of wind. Eventually, corridors at several different levels of ventilation were extracted by classifying the line densities of least cost paths, which were effectively verified through land surface temperature retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The new model is more scientific and convenient than traditional urban construction environmental assessment software in terms of data acquisition and hardware support. The results suggest that urban design based on urban morphology and building height and considering the direction and frequency of wind would be effective for optimizing ventilation to regulate urban environmental problems.},

Using high-resolution remote sensing mapping image data to design scientific and efficient algorithms to excavate and plan urban ventilation corridors and improve urban ventilation environment is an effective way to solve these problems. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) tilt photography technology to obtain high-precision remote sensing image digital elevation model ({DEM}) and digital surface model ({DSM}) data, count the city’s dominant wind direction in each season using long-term meteorological data, and use building height to calculate the dominant wind direction. The projection algorithm calculates the windward area density of this dominant direction. Under the guidance of K-means, the binarized windward area density map is used to determine each area and boundary of potential ventilation corridors within the threshold range, and the length and angle of each area’s fitted elliptical long axis are calculated to extract the ventilation corridors that meet the criteria. On the basis of high-precision stereo remote sensing data from {UAV}, the paper uses image classification, segmentation, fitting, and fusion algorithms to intelligently mine potential urban ventilation corridors, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study in Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province.},

These three years have been chosen based on the time when spatial planning law was introduced and different local zoning plans for Warsaw were passed, including preserved areas for the ventilation corridors. The roughness parameters mapping focuses mainly on frontal area index calculation and itis based on the building database partially derived from satellite imagery ({SPOT}). Comparison of the derived corridors with the officially planned preservation areas suggests inaccuracies in their extent, identifies obstacles that occurred over almost twenty years and calls for an evaluation. The proposed analysis might be used by local authorities to revise the shape of existing corridors and to recognise problematic areas, which could lead to better spatial management.},

Morphometric analysis of urban structure allowed establishing a proper database of aerodynamic parameters of the city.

Over the past decades, climate change has become among the top issues challenging cities worldwide, endangering the urban infrastructures and threatening the health of millions of people. Hence, climate action, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, has become a priority for urban planning. This work introduces an example of the promising role that spatial analysis and statistical modelling, employing Geographical Information Systems ({GIS}) and freely available satellite and land-based data, can provide in supporting urban climate design and policymaking. In particular, this study puts special attention on the Urban Heat Island ({UHI}) phenomenon. Here, we first introduce a simple, but effective morphological-based approach for mapping potential ventilation corridors across cities of uniform built-up structure, as a common {UHI} mitigation measure. Then, we propose a methodology for assessing the relative role of these corridors in maximizing the impacts of green solutions upon lowering high temperature. Results show that even under very calm wind conditions, there is still an opportunity for maximizing the benefits of greening measures on the urban climate. Also, it has been demonstrated that green ventilation corridors are more effective during night-time when the {UHI} effect is peaked. The research findings are very promising, especially for cities where wind is a marginal potentiality.},

	abstract = {Due to rapid urbanization, China's urban morphology has undergone tremendous changes, resulting in an increased urban heat island ({UHI}) effect and negative impact of thermal environment, especially in summer. Studying the scale effect between urban wind and thermal environment can provide the best scale for the wind environment planning on mitigating {UHI} effect. Taking Dalian as an example, using multi-source data, a nonlinear correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the frontal area index ({FAI}) and land 77uuyyhsurface temperature ({LST}) under different grids. The results show that first, {FAI} is sensitive to grid-size changes. When the grid size increases from 25 × 25 m to 150 × 150 m with a step size of 25 m, in July, the numbers of grids with {FAI} {\textgreater} 1 are 19,992, 1538, 153, 20, 4, and 0 (0\%) accounting for 2.106\%, 0.645\%, 0.081\%, 0.019\%, 0.006\%, and 0\% of the total, respectively.

Second, the most effective grid size to study the relationship between {FAI} and {LST} is 25 m. When the grid size increases from 25 m to 300 m with a step size of 25 m, the correlation between {FAI} and {LST} shows a significant decrease.

	abstract = {Urban ventilation corridors serve as channels of fresh air flow between the city and suburbs, helping to improve the wind and thermal environments and thermal comfort. However, owing to the limited number of weather stations, it is impossible to quantitatively reveal the effective effect range of urban ventilation corridors on urban thermal comfort at the scale of 100 × 100 m, which is optimal for urban ventilation corridors. In this study, we integrated building data, the European Centre for Medium-Range weather forecast data ({ECMWF}), {MOD}13Q1, and other multisource data to analyse the effect of urban ventilation corridors on urban thermal comfort at a unified scale of 100 × 100 m. The results showed that {ECMWF} and Landsat8 data could be used as substitute factors to improve the universal thermal climate index ({UTCI}) urban spatial resolution. The effective range of urban ventilation corridor effects on the urban surface temperature and urban comfort was ≤1000 m, with building density and vegetation coverage as the main factors limiting this range. Therefore, attention should be paid to the effective range of urban ventilation corridors, the surrounding building density, vegetation coverage, and the rational use of urban ventilation corridors to reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning in summer.},

	abstract = {Cities, recognized as one of the roughest surfaces, significantly reduce wind velocity. This leads to a greater concentration of pollution and increased temperature in urban areas. A proper urban design may promote the air flow and mitigate these negative phenomena. This paper describes a novel approach to detect and analyze the potential urban ventilation corridors. The concept is based on the morphometric analyses, where roughness parameters (such as roughness length and displacement height), as well as porosity are investigated as opposed to previous studies. Commonly available light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) data enable more detailed terrain study, as the topography and obstacle features (type, dimensions, and porosity) might be investigated. In comparison to the previous studies and long adapted practices, this approach takes advantage of all information incorporated in {LiDAR} data to deliver even more accurate results. The comparison of the detected corridors, with the officially designed corridors in our study area in Warsaw, suggests inaccuracies in their extent (only 40\% of their areas might still be functioning) and calls for an evaluation. The results deliver areas that may be recognized as urban ventilation corridors and serve as air regeneration and ventilation system. They may also be used for developing new solutions for continuously evolving cities.},
